# Welcome to Technomalia!

You have found your way our RMIT study-group's website, which exists purely as an assignment exercise to showcase our teams remarkable level of awesome - both individual and group - and to demonstrate that awesome with the various tasks and assessments we'll be given from now until the end of the Introduction to Information Technology course.

If you're a group member who's unsure what you should do now you're here, <i>start</i> by giving your feedback - tell us how you think our site should look or feel and what is wrong/right about it so far.

Here's the proposed site-map I've got so far:

```
Welcome

Articles -> Cloud Computing
         -> Raspberry Pi
         -> Machine Learning
         -> ???

Products -> Hardware -> SmartPet-20(20)

Information -> About Technomalia
            -> Meet the Team
            -> Resource Links
```

I know there's the four 1,200 word reports everyone's doing, but do we want them all just shoved in the one page or a separate page for each?

Tell me what other pages you'll need.
