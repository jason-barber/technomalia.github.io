# Welcome to Technomalia!

You have found your way our RMIT study-group's website, which exists purely as an assignment exercise to showcase our teams remarkable level of awesome - both individual and group assets - and to demonstrate that awesome with the various tasks and assessments we'll be given from now until the end of the Introduction to Information Technology course.

If you're a group member who's unsure what you should do now you're here, start by giving your opinion and feedback on how you think our site should look and what it should be doing.
