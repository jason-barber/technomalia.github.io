# Welcome to Technomalia!

You have found your way our RMIT study-group's website, which exists purely as an assignment exercise to showcase our teams remarkable level of awesome - both individual and group - and to demonstrate that awesome with the various tasks and assessments we'll be given from now until the end of the Introduction to Information Technology course.

The actual site is here: https://technomalia.github.io

If you're a group member who's unsure what you should do now you're here, <i>start</i> by giving your feedback - tell us how you think our site should look or feel and what is wrong/right about it and incidentally - the dog silhouette logo is just a spur of the moment scribble to fill in until we've got a better one, unless we don't create a better one which is fine too I don't care, long as shit's gettin' <i>done</i> and not just discussed.

Here's the proposed site-map I've got so far:

```
Technomalia

Articles -> Cloud Computing
         -> Raspberry Pi
         -> Machine Learning
         -> ???

Products -> SmartPet-20(20) [Product Intro .. Product Image .. Product Features .. Product Specs]

Information -> About Technomalia
            -> Meet the Team
            -> Resource Links
```
Really, I've gotta get an open line of communication going with Tara: waiting until the group sessions leaves a lot of days without any back and forth at all and it's hard to design or construct anything with a combination of 50/50 input from two people if those two people are only comparing notes twice a week - we should be able to present a functional site by Tuesday, yet Tuesday will be the first opportunity we've had to even collaborate about it.

Everyone else, I can just copy/paste their reports or writing into the site and neaten it, but without the visual design half of the site creation I don't know what I'll be looking at in a week.

I know there's the four 1,200 word reports everyone's doing, but do we want them all just shoved in the one page or a separate page for each?

Tell me what other pages you'll need while I'll have a look for a better menu-bar before bedtime Sunday night.
